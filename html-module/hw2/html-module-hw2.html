                Justin Peter Griffin (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) is the patriarch of the Griffin household, a 45-year-old Irish-American blue-collar worker. For most of the series, Peter is shown as an obese, unintelligent, lazy, outspoken, childish, and eccentric alcoholic. He has several jobs, which have included working at the Happy Go Lucky Toy Factory, a fisherman, and currently as a shipping clerk at the Pawtucket Patriot Ale Brewery. It is discovered that his legal first name is Justin, in the season 13 episode "Quagmire's Mom".

            <p>
                Lois Patrice Griffin (née Pewterschmidt) (voiced by Alex Borstein) is the matriarch of the Griffin household, Peter's wife, and the mother of Meg, Chris, and Stewie. She is a 43-year-old German-American, and has a Jewish mother who is a holocaust survivor. She is a housewife who cares deeply for her kids and her husband, while also working as a piano instructor.

        <p>
            Margaret Winnifred "Meg" Griffin (voiced by Lacey Chabert in season 1, Mila Kunis since season 2) is the Griffins' 18-year-old daughter and oldest child. She is a self-conscious, insecure, and sensitive teenager who is more often than not ridiculed and ignored by the people around her. Meg just wants to be another face in the crowd by fitting in with her peers and being accepted, but she often finds herself to be a victim of circumstance. She has had several love interests over the course of the series, including Brian Griffin, Mayor Adam West, Tom Tucker, Glenn Quagmire, and Joe Swanson.

        <p>
            Christopher Cross "Chris" Griffin (voiced by Seth Green) is the Griffins' 14-year-old son and middle child. He is a friendly, laid-back, and funny teenager who is a younger version of Peter physically, but intellectually, he often shows more potential, as demonstrated from moments of coherence and articulation within his speech. Chris, can however, be scatterbrained and is easily confused, something Peter frequently takes for granted.

        <li>Stewie Griffin</li>

        <p>
            Stewart Gilligan "Stewie" Griffin (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) is the Griffin's 1-year-old child, but often behaves in adult ways such as speaking in an upper-class British dialect. He is a child genius who frequently aspired to murder his mother Lois and take over the world but has since mellowed out considerably. He turned 1 year old in "Chitty Chitty Death Bang," and has not aged past one year since.

        <li>Brian Griffin
        <div class="img-div">

            <p>
                Brian H. Griffin (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) is the family's 8-year-old anthropomorphic talking white Labrador Retriever and the best friend of both Stewie and Peter. He and Stewie are often at the center of the show's most critically acclaimed episodes, most notably the "Road to..." episodes, where he and Stewie go on road-trips together. Brian is portrayed as an intellectual—a Brown University attendee—who often serves as the family's voice of reason, pointing out how ridiculous Peter's ideas are. He is not-so-secretly in love with Lois and is an unsuccessful, unemployed writer.

    <h3>Executive producers</h3>
<p>MacFarlane has served as an executive producer during the show's entire history. The first executive producers were David Zuckerman, Lolee Aries, David Pritchard, and Mike Wolf. Family Guy has had many executive producers in its history, including Daniel Palladino, Kara Vallow, and Danny Smith. David A. Goodman joined the show as a co-executive producer in season three, and eventually became an executive producer. Alex Borstein, who voices Lois, worked as an executive and supervising producer for the fourth and fifth seasons</p>
    <h3>Writing</h3>
    <p>The first team of writers assembled for the show consisted of Chris Sheridan, Danny Smith, Gary Janetti, Ricky Blitt, Neil Goldman, Garrett Donovan, Matt Weitzman, and Mike Barker. The writing process of Family Guy generally starts with 14 writers that take turns writing the scripts; when a script is finished it is given to the rest of the writers to read. These scripts generally include cutaway gags. Various gags are pitched to MacFarlane and the rest of the staff, and those deemed funniest are included in the episode. MacFarlane has explained that normally it takes 10 months to produce an episode because the show uses hand-drawn animation. The show rarely comments on current events for this reason. The show's initial writers had never written for an animated show; and most came from live-action sitcoms</p>

    <h3>Broadcast</h3>
    <p>In the United States, Family Guy has aired on Fox since its premiere on January 31, 1999. The show has been syndicated on Adult Swim and TBS since 2003, with both networks holding the rights to the first fifteen seasons of the series. In April 2019, FXX and Freeform began airing reruns of season 16 and started season 17 in October. In 2021, FXX and Freeform will become the exclusive cable network for reruns, which means Family Guy will leave the Adult Swim and TBS lineups. This will not affect local syndication stations rights to rerun the series. Local syndication stations have the rights to the first seventeen seasons.[216]

        Family Guy premiered in Australia on April 9, 1999, on the Seven Network, in 2000 on Fox8, and on 7mate on September 27, 2010.[217] In Canada, the series premiered January 31, 1999 on Global[218] and September 1, 2003 on Teletoon. Beginning in the 2015–2016 season, the show moved to City.[219] In addition to Teletoon, the show has been syndicated to TVtropolis (now DTour), Cartoon Network, and FXX. Since the discontinuation of Teletoon at Night and Cartoon Network's Adult Swim programming blocks, Family Guy has been airing on the Adult Swim channel since April 1, 2019. The show also airs in India on Star World Premiere,[220] in Ireland on 3e,[221] and in New Zealand on Four.[222]

        In the United Kingdom, Family Guy premiered in September 1999, originally on Channel 4 and Sky One. In January 2005, FX (now Fox) began broadcasting the show.[223] From October 2005, BBC Two[224] started screening Family Guy before switching to BBC Three in September 2006.[225] In March 2015, it was announced that season 14 of Family Guy and all of MacFarlane's other cartoons would transfer to ITV2, premiering on February 29, 2016,[226][227] while the BBC would continue to hold the rights until 2017 for older episodes</p>
