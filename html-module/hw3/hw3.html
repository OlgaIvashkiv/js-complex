                Justin Peter Griffin (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) is the patriarch of the Griffin household, a 45-year-old Irish-American blue-collar worker. For most of the series, Peter is shown as an obese, unintelligent, lazy, outspoken, childish, and eccentric alcoholic. He has several jobs, which have included working at the Happy Go Lucky Toy Factory, a fisherman, and currently as a shipping clerk at the Pawtucket Patriot Ale Brewery. It is discovered that his legal first name is Justin, in the season 13 episode "Quagmire's Mom".

            Margaret Winnifred "Meg" Griffin (voiced by Lacey Chabert in season 1, Mila Kunis since season 2) is the Griffins' 18-year-old daughter and oldest child. She is a self-conscious, insecure, and sensitive teenager who is more often than not ridiculed and ignored by the people around her. Meg just wants to be another face in the crowd by fitting in with her peers and being accepted, but she often finds herself to be a victim of circumstance. She has had several love interests over the course of the series, including Brian Griffin, Mayor Adam West, Tom Tucker, Glenn Quagmire, and Joe Swanson.

            Christopher Cross "Chris" Griffin (voiced by Seth Green) is the Griffins' 14-year-old son and middle child. He is a friendly, laid-back, and funny teenager who is a younger version of Peter physically, but intellectually, he often shows more potential, as demonstrated from moments of coherence and articulation within his speech. Chris, can however, be scatterbrained and is easily confused, something Peter frequently takes for granted.

            Stewart Gilligan "Stewie" Griffin (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) is the Griffin's 1-year-old child, but often behaves in adult ways such as speaking in an upper-class British dialect. He is a child genius who frequently aspired to murder his mother Lois and take over the world but has since mellowed out considerably. He turned 1 year old in "Chitty Chitty Death Bang," and has not aged past one year since.

            Brian H. Griffin (voiced by Seth MacFarlane) is the family's 8-year-old anthropomorphic talking white Labrador Retriever and the best friend of both Stewie and Peter. He and Stewie are often at the center of the show's most critically acclaimed episodes, most notably the "Road to..." episodes, where he and Stewie go on road-trips together. Brian is portrayed as an intellectual—a Brown University attendee—who often serves as the family's voice of reason, pointing out how ridiculous Peter's ideas are. He is not-so-secretly in love with Lois and is an unsuccessful, unemployed writer.
